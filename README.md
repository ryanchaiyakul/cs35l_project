# CS35L Project

## Running Instructions

### Flask

```bash
python -m venv env                  # Using Python 3.11.3 for testing
source env/Script/activate          # This is for Windows. Unix uses env/bin/activate for virtual environments I think
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

### React

```bash
npm start                           # To be completely honest, I have no clue how node js seupt works
```

**I do not know how react works with npm and npx and how it interacts with Windows vs Unix. If anyone knows a better way to do react app setup please redo the implementation or teach me how to.**
